                    <p> Hello! I’m Kayla Marcus, public relations major at the University of Florida. I grew up a dedicated student and ballet dancer, spending all of my free time in the ballet studio perfecting my technique for the fulfilling moments of performing on stage. I transitioned into the next stage of my life as a dance major at the University of Florida. During the first semester of college, I took a journalism class which sparked my interest in the field of journalism and communications. In the spring, I officially switched my major to public relations and began a new journey to find my niche promoting both the arts and active lifestyles through various communication strategies. </p>       
<p> I currently have a health and fitness motif aligning with my public relations experience. I blog for a national health-technology start-up called peerFit, which promotes group fitness through multiple styles of gyms. I am also training to become a group fitness instructor at UF RecSports. I hope to teach ballet strength and yoga classes in the Fall!   </p>
        
                        <p>Studying abroad was one of the most eye-opening experiences of my life.I was able to gain valuable blogging experience last summer when I blogged for the UF International Center from Tel Aviv, Israel. I’m looking forward to studying abroad in London and Paris this summer with the Journalism school, and then I'm heading to New York City for a public relations internship at Lippe Taylor, a marketing communications agency focused on women’s purchasing patterns. I have so much to be excited about! I’m looking forward to the next few months and the rest of my college career to see where I can successfully combine my passions for awareness of heath, creativity,and meaningful artistic endeavors. </p>
