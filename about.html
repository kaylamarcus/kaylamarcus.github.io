                    <p> Hello! I’m Kayla Marcus, public relations major at the University of Florida. I grew up a dedicated student and ballet dancer, spending all of my free time in the ballet studio perfecting my technique for the fulfilling moments of performing on stage. I transitioned into the next stage of my life as a dance major at the University of Florida. During the first semester of college, in addition to my dance classes, I took an intro to journalism which sparked my interest in the field of journalism and communications. In thespring, I officially switched my major to public relations and began a new journey to find my specificniche within the field. </p>       
<p> I currently have a health and fitness motif aligning with my public relations experience. I blog for a national health-technology start-up called peerFit, and I am getting trained to become a group fitnessinstructor at UF RecSports. I gained valuable blogging experience as a blogger for the UF International Center when I studied abroad in Tel Aviv,Israel last summer.  </p>
        
                        <p>Studying abroad was one of the most eye-opening experiences of my life. I’m looking forward to studying abroad in London and Paris this summerwith the journalism school, then potentially going to New York City for a public relations internship at Lippe Taylor, a marketing communications agency focused on women’s purchasing patterns.  I have so much to be excited about! I’m looking forward to the next few months and the rest of my college career to see where I can successfully combine my passions for awareness of heath, creativity,and meaningful artistic endeavors. </p>
