             <p> Practice makes perfect.</p>
             <p> African dance requires three easy steps: </p>
             <p>  <h3> 1. Practice by watching </h3> </p>
             <p> One must first watch the movements from others who are more experienced in African dance. By watching, you can see and feel the movement of the body and how it reacts to the beat of the drums playing. Watch how the experienced dancers pick up their knees dramatically between each step. Notice the amount of energy and enthusiasm needed to execute each step. Try to imitate that. </p> 
            <p> <h3> 2.  Practice by doing </h3> </p>
             <p> This is where the bulk of the work comes in. After watching how the dance is performed, one must repeatedly practice of the movements until it becomes familiar in their body. Practice with the drums an match the energy that the drummers are producing. This is not an easy task and may take some time. Repetition is required to build the proper muscle memory for African dance. </p>

 </div>
             <p> <h3> 3. Practice by listening </h3> </p>
             <p> After aquiring the movements in your mind, you must listen to the drum beats to know how to move your body in the correct rythm. From the video, you can see everyone has a slight variation on what their perception of the correct beat of the music. Sometimes, the drummer will speed up the beats or slow down the beats. You must respond to how the drummer is playing to successfully execute the dance. To transition from one step to another, the drummer will indicate a special break in the music. This will be a distict sound, composed on a different rythm of beats, indicating that you are moving onto the next movement. Watch the video to see if you can hear the breaks from the drummers, and see how the dancers respond. </p>

             <p> The most rewarding part about African dance is that you can perform the movements anywhere for friends and family. In the pictures above, I had the opportunity to perform with some of my friends for a Rwanada benefit concert. It was one of my favorite memories from the semester. After watching, doing, and listening, you can become confident in your own African dancing. Then, you will be ready to teach the African dance to others! </p>
